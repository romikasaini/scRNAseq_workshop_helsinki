Please find following files/data in this git repository.

1. Packages_required.txt: This file contains the list of R packages which need to be installed prior to the workshop. 
2. Excercise_commands.Rmd: Contains the list of R commands required for analysing the single cell RNA-seq data using seurat and few other tools, which we will be going through during the workshop sessions.
3. data1.zip: Contains the example data which we will using during the workshop sessions.
4. data2.zip: Contains another set of example data.
